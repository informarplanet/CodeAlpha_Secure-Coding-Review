# Secure Coding Review and Guidelines

This repository contains examples of both vulnerable and secure Python web applications to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities and their fixes.

## Files
- `app.py`: Example of vulnerable code with common security issues
- `secure_app.py`: Secure version with implemented best practices
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Security Vulnerabilities Demonstrated

1. **SQL Injection**
   - Never use string concatenation for SQL queries
   - Use parameterized queries or ORM (SQLAlchemy)
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs

2. **Password Security**
   - Never store plain-text passwords
   - Use strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Avoid MD5/SHA1 for password hashing
   - Implement proper password policies
   - Enforce minimum password length (at least 12 characters)
   - Require combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Implement password history to prevent reuse
   - Add rate limiting for login attempts

3. **Session Management**
   - Use secure session keys
   - Store sensitive data in environment variables
   - Implement proper session timeout
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure flags)
   - Regular session rotation
   - Clear sessions on logout
   - Implement IP-based session validation

4. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use whitelisting over blacklisting
   - Implement proper content security policies
   - Prevent XSS attacks through proper escaping
   - Use HTML sanitization libraries
   - Implement request size limits
   - Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
   - Use prepared statements for database queries

5. **File Operations**
   - Prevent path traversal attacks
   - Validate file paths and types
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use secure file handling methods
   - Implement file upload scanning
   - Set proper file permissions
   - Use secure temporary file creation
   - Implement file type validation

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication middleware
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement MFA where possible
   - Regular session validation
   - Use OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication
   - Implement JWT with proper signing
   - Regular audit of user permissions
   - Implement principle of least privilege

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Different configs for dev/prod
   - Disable debug mode in production
   - Implement proper logging
   - Use secrets management service
   - Regular rotation of credentials
   - Implement proper backup strategies
   - Use configuration validation

3. **Dependencies**
   - Regular security updates
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Maintain updated requirements.txt
   - Review third-party packages
   - Implement automated dependency updates
   - Use virtual environments
   - Pin dependency versions
   - Regular security audits

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Don't expose stack traces
   - Log errors securely
   - Return appropriate status codes
   - Use custom error pages
   - Implement proper logging levels
   - Monitor application health
   - Set up alerts for critical errors

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **API Security**
   - Use API keys or tokens for authentication
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Validate request payloads
   - Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Version your APIs
   - Document security requirements
   - Regular API security testing

2. **Database Security**
   - Regular database backups
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement database access logging
   - Regular security patching
   - Use database user roles
   - Implement query timeouts
   - Monitor database performance

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Use WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Implement DDoS protection
   - Regular security scanning
   - Network segmentation
   - Use secure protocols (TLS 1.3)
   - Regular system updates
   - Implement monitoring
   - Use container security

4. **Code Security**
   - Regular code reviews
   - Use static code analysis
   - Implement secure coding standards
   - Use version control
   - Implement CI/CD security checks
   - Code signing
   - Secure deployment process
   - Regular security training

## Security Testing
- Use automated security scanning tools
- Perform regular code reviews
- Implement security testing in CI/CD
- Regular penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security compliance checks
- Threat modeling
- Bug bounty programs

## Incident Response
- Have an incident response plan
- Regular security drills
- Document security procedures
- Maintain contact lists
- Set up monitoring alerts
- Regular backup testing
- Define severity levels
- Post-incident analysis
